### MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

### Elastic Search

Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. Logstash and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and enriching your data and storing it in Elasticsearch. Kibana enables you to interactively explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage and monitor the stack. Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis magic happens, providing near real-time search and analytics for all types of data.

**To set up Elasticsearch**, [follow this guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).

### Hazelcast

[Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/) is an in-memory distributed cache. In-Memory Data Grids (IMDG) aim to provide extremely high data availability by keeping it in memory and in a highly distributed fashion.

You can view Hazelcast's performance details via the Hazelcast management center application. To configure this, you first need to [download the application](https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads).

## Additional Resources

- For detailed installation and configuration of MongoDB, refer to the [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/).

- Set up Elasticsearch by following the guidelines in the [Elasticsearch Reference Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).
